# Querkles Mini

**Querkles Mini** is a web-based creative tool that transforms any uploaded image into a *Querkles*-style coloring artwork. The effect uses overlapping numbered circles, where each number corresponds to a color in a chosen palette. Once colored in, the overlapping circles reveal a complete image â€” like pixel art, but made of circles.
